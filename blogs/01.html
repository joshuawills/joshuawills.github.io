                <h1>creating a compiler in Java - the start:</h1>
                <h3><i>Written 16.01.2024 | Blog Post 01.</i></h3>
                <p>
                I'm writing this blog post as a way for me to chronicle the development of my own <i>xy</i> language, a compiled language similar in style to C.
                I hope throughout the year to continue developing it as preparation for my potential thesis research on the topics of compilers. My interest in compilers 
                has come largely out of watching this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcSijrRsrY0&t=12s">youtube series</a>, however I have already deviated
                in several significant ways from this series' development.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have written the compiler in Java rather than C++. This was largely a decision based on existing skills (I've never written C++)</li>
                    <li>Although I originally created assembly code in the "generation" phase, I have since switched that to C, as I believe the very small abstraction cost is justified by
                        the increased development speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>My language is strongly typed, following a C-style approach to variable declaration. I'm also stealing Rust's approach to immutability, where variables have to be explicity 
                        defined as mutable.
                    </li>
                    <li>I have placed an emphasis on documentation and configuration tools. Users of the language can specify compiler flags and see the source code easily for debugging.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                So far, I have already written a sufficiently complex enough compiler to compute any kind of mathematical problem. The compiler, regardless, is lacking in several key areas however, which
                I hope to develop over the next several months. The most significant, I would argue, is the lack of supported data types. I fear that I have developed the compiler in a way that does not easily support
                the creation of new data types. A significant refactoring process will be required to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                I will start with easier data types, <i>booleans</i>, <i>strings</i>, <i>chars</i>, and <i>arrays</i> (in the C sense, not like a <i>vector</i> or a <i>list</i>). Later on, I will also
                try to create standard libraries with support for vectors, hash maps, trees, graphs, etc. This will also give me the opportunity to brush up on my C knowledge (given the compiler generates C code,
                it's only natural to write the libraries in C). 
                </p>
                <p>
                When it comes to error handling in my language, I'm still unsure of the correct approach. An appealing method to me is the <i>"Go"</i> approach, where 
                functions return an error. With this I could add an additional compiler flag which could mandate users handle all potential errors, but also ignore them 
                in some cases (similar to an unwrap or something like that).
                </p>
                <p>
                Clearly there's still a lot to consider, so I have decided to order my priorities to focus on in developing my compiler. With this comes a consistent approach to maintaining a rich test suite (something I've been lazy
                in doing so far) and developing tools to accommodate these features.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Supporting additional data types</li>
                    <li>Developing a unified approach to error handling</li>
                    <li>Creating standard libraries for common use cases (math, regex, networking, io, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Maintaining the VS code extension to support new features</li>
                    <li>More detailed error messages from the compiler</li>
                    <li>Establishing a formal grammar/syntax for <i>xy</i></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Notably, I will also try and continue to make blog posts to highlight any significant changes to the compiler. Below I have provided some simple programs that one can try out themselves!
                </p>
                <h3><i>Code Examples.</i></h3>
<p>1. The classic hello world</p>
<pre style="text-align: left;">
define main() -> int {
    out "hello, world!\n";
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>2. Is the number even?</p>
<pre style="text-align: left;">
define isEven(int x) -> int {
    return x % 2 == 0;
}

define main() -> int {
    int x = in "Enter your favourite number here :) ";
    if isEven(x) {
        out "This number is even!\n";
    } else {
        out "This number is odd!\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>3. Finding the HCF (or GCD).</p>
<pre style="text-align: left;">
define min(int a, int b) -> int {
    if a < b return a;
    else return b;
}

define gcd(int a, int b) -> int {
    mut int result = min(a, b);
    while result > 0 {
        if (a % result == 0 && b % result == 0) break;
        result--;
    }
    return result;
}

define main() -> int {
    int a = 98; int b = 56;
    out gcd(a, b);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>4. Fizzbuzz classic.</p>
<pre style="text-align: left;">
// Takes in number, calculates fizzbuzz 
// from 0 to that number
define fizzbuzz(int n) -> int {
    mut int i = 0;
    while i < n {
        if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
            out "FizzBuzz\n";
        } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
            out "Fizz\n";
        } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
            out "Buzz\n";
        } else {
            out i;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}

define main() -> int {
    int input = in "enter a number: ";
    if input <= 0 {
        out "Enter a positive number\n";
        return 1;
    }
    int x = fizzbuzz(input);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
