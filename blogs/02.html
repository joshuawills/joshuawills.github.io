                <h1>a rudimentary type checker:</h1>
                <h3><i>Written 22.01.2024 | Blog Post 02.</i></h3>
                <p>
                    It's been a couple days since I last provided an update on the state of the 'xy' compiler.
                    I ended my last blog listing several key achievements to work towards in the successive weeks,
                    which have (sort of) been addressed. However, shortly after writing that blog, I realized
                    there was a significant chunk of the compilation process that I was missing, <i>type checking</i>.
                    My existing approach to handle user error in the source code, whether that be accessing a non-existent variable 
                    or missing a semicolon, was to delegate such error-handling to the parser and code generation stages. This, as I
                    considered new additions to the programming language however, was clearly not a sustainable approach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As such, I have just spent a decent chunk of the last day developing a formal type-checker that lies between the parser and code-generation (as seen in the below diagram). This doesn't 
                    mean that there is no validation occurring outside of this phase, but it does mean any existing responsibility layed on the code generation has been ported to an independent
                    class, and more advanced type checking has been enabled to accommodate a new 'string' data type. The Verification class interestingly enough operates in largely the same way
                    that the code generator does, recursively traveling down AST nodes for expressions to ensure there isn't a string lying around in a mathematical expression or anything like that.
                    This experience has caused me to consider an interesting software engineering concept regarding when is the right time to 'abstract away'. The natural end goal of a project like this would be to
                    extend beyond a simple non-optimizing compiler. That likely will necessitate adding a new intermediate representation (IR) stage, and another optimization filtering process which works with the IR.
                    But when is the right time to create these abstractions...

                    <i>A rough diagram outlining the current structure of the 'xy' compiler</i>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Other notable additions to the compiler since the last post is the ability for users to load in compiler settings, adding a level of customization and, arguably, linting to their development flow.
                    I've also created a <i>UnaryExpression</i> type independent of <i>BinaryExpression</i>, so that a statement like <i>i++;</i> doesn't get parsed to <i>i = i + 1;</i>. This was easier in the context of generating assembly,
                    but not necessary when the target code is C.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the next week, I will continue to improve the type-checker to make a truly comprehensive system. At the moment my compiler doesn't ensure a function returns what it says it will, so I have to look into that...
                    Furthermore, I will continue to add more primitive types, such as booleans (which I suspect will be quite easy), arrays and maybe even structs.
                </p>
                <h3><i>Code Examples.</i></h3>
<p>1. Is your number prime?</p>
<pre style="text-align: left;">
define isPrime(int x) -> int {

    if x == 0 || x == 1 return false;

    mut int i = 2;

    while i <= x / 2 {
        if x % i == 0 {
            return false;
        }
        i++;
    }

    return true;
}

define main() -> int {

    int x = in "Enter a number: ";

    if isPrime(x) {
        out "You entered a prime number\n";
    } else {
        out "You entered a composite number\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>2. The Euclidean algorithm.</p>
<pre style="text-align: left;">
define main() -> int {

    int x = in "Enter a positive number here: ";
    int y = in "Enter a positive number here: ";

    if x <= 0 || y <= 0 {
        out "You didn't provide a positive number :(\n";
        return 1;
    }

    out euclid(x, y);

    return 0;
}

define euclid(int x, int y) -> int {
    if (x == 0)
        return y;
    return euclid((y % x), x);
}
</pre>
<p>3. Factorial calculation for integers</p>
<pre style="text-align: left;">
    define main() -> int {
        out factorial(5);
        return 0;
    }
    
    define factorial(int x) -> int {
        if x <= 1 {
            return 1;
        }
        int less = n - 1;
        return x * factorial(less);
    }
</pre>
